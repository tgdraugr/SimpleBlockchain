# Simple Blockchain

_A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks._

_Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable as forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance._

## Introduction

What is the best way to learn about blockchain? By building one, with help from [Learn Blockchain by Building One](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Blockchain-Building-Understanding-Cryptocurrencies/dp/1484251709).

This project is to be used as a playground for building a simple blockchain node, using the tools and techniques I know better.
